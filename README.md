# "Effective C" study repository

I'm just a JavaScript/TypeScript developer, and over time, doing the same thing in every same language and framework just hurts my brain. I need to do something different, learn something new. The two major areas I want to learn in are **Python** and the **C** family of languages. 

This repo is specifically for the C programming language. More specifically, I am following Robert C. Seacord's [*Effective C*](https://nostarch.com/Effective_C), published by No Starch Press. Reading up on C/C++, I was convinced that I should learn C first, and then learn C++, as the latter builds upon the former. (I've dabbled with C# in the past, so I'll study that later.)
